                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Joywave is an American indie rock band from Rochester, New York, formed in 2010. Their lineup
                    consists of Daniel Armbruster (vocals), Joseph Morinelli (guitar), and Paul Brenner (drums). The
                    band first became known for its collaboration with electronic music project Big Data, "Dangerous",
                    which peaked at number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in 2014. After releasing two
                    EPs, their debut album, How Do You Feel Now?, was released through their own Cultco Music label, an
                    imprint of Hollywood Records, in 2015. Their second album, Content, was released on July 28, 2017.
                    It was followed by their third album, Possession, which was released on March 13, 2020. Their fourth
                    album, Cleanse, was released on February 11, 2022.
